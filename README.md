#Inspiration
Inspired by help ticketing systems like Zendesk

#What it does
Instead of using an external web application, Alfred uses Slack to communicate between the user and the support personel. Each ticket is essentially a channel, allowing for the use of many different integrations by the support team in the channel. However, the user will only see messages explicitly intended for them. A message is sent from the slack channel to the user by mentioning @alfred in the message

#How we built it
We used JavaScript to code the functionality of the bot and HTML for the customer's interface with some CSS

#Challenges we ran into
One of the most difficult tasks was adapting to the programming style of Node.JS. The other difficult task was to understand and use the API to communicate with the slack team.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
IT WORKS

#What we learned
We learned how to successfully implement a simple slack bot as well as how to setup and use Node.JS

#What's next for Alfred: Customer Support, with a little more slack
Whats next? Well, the possibilities are honestly endless. Slack offers so many features in its API that we haven't implemented yet, like file sharing.

#Installation

Setup your tokens accordingly in token/token.js then Run app.js!
